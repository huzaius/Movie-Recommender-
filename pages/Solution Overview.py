st.markdown(f'''Having been given a sourced and clean data set, (the MovieLens dataset) which has been pre-enriched with additional data, and resampled for fair evaluation purposes, We have a task to use this raw data to build a Recommendation system algorithm (Screen lot) based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based on their historical preferences. The idea of this algorithm is to predict the movies that would be enjoyed by a viewer based on their reactions to the movies that they have already watched. For more information on how Screenlot works and the technical details of the App, please check out the ***documentation*** page.''')
